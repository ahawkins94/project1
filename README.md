## Instructions
Instructions from the game:

Oh what's that in the bottom left? That spec.... That's a slime! Slimes are a valuable asset - even a currency! But yours is just a baby, he needs feeding. Click the slime food in the top left corner to feed it. Once you have enough slime you can spend your slime to employ workers in the shop! Put them to work by clicking them when they are on the bench. Be careful though, tending to slimes is stressful work. If your workers get too stressed they will neglect the slime!

The aim of the game is to grow your slime as large as possible.
